// Big O

// Big O notation is mathematically notation that describes the limiting behavior of
// a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.
// We use Big O to describe the performance of a algorithm. o(n)
// Certain operations can be more or less costly depending on which data structure we
// use e.g: accessing an array element using index is very fast but if array is resized
// this will get costly as size of input grows very large then we can use LINKED LIST
// that can grow or shrink very quickly but accessing that using index is slow.
